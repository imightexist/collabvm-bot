# collabvm-bot
this is your fault. you shouldn't have clicked here. this is basically unzor's fylrobot (pretty cool check it out) but other people can type in commands rather than one person

# "hosting" the bot
you can use a nodejs script that runs it in a browser or just copy the code inside console

# make one yourself?
eh sure why not, example.js is kinda customizable for you to make a bot
